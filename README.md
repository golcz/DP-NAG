The code is saved in Python notebook (originally used Colab to run this code).

To run the code and see results:

1. Install all the dependancy packages from Python, these include Pytorch, Torchvision, and Opacus.
2. Run the model and data cell (first cell)
3. Run the Simulate_Mnist cell. 
4. Run any other experiment cells to reproduce any of the graphs. Feel free to change any parameters.
